Our team is implementing the classic card game:

> **🎮 Chosen Game: _War_**

The game logic will be built on top of the provided base code, which includes classes for cards, hands, and basic game structure. 
The focus of this project is to apply object-oriented programming principles, not to create a graphical user interface.
