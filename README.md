# SYST 17796 – Card Game Project (Deliverable 1)

This repository contains the base code and documentation for our card game project as part of **Deliverable 1** for the **SYST 17796 - Object-Oriented Software Design** course at Sheridan College.

Our team is implementing the classic card game:

> **🎮 Chosen Game: _War_**

The game logic will be built on top of the provided base code, which includes classes for cards, hands, and basic game structure. 
The focus of this project is to apply object-oriented programming principles, not to create a graphical user interface.
